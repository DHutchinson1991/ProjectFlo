## 1. Guiding Principle 🎯

This roadmap is structured to deliver functional, end-to-end user workflows in phases. Each phase builds upon the last, ensuring that core logic is in place before dependent features are developed.

> **Core Strategy:**  
> Establish the **"brain"** of the system first, then build the user-facing experiences that rely on it.

<!-- ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ PHASE 1 ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ -->

## 2. Phase 1: Foundation & Service Configuration 🏛️

<!-- ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS (Post Phase 3 / Non-Crucial for Initial MVP) ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ -->

## 5. Future Considerations & Deferred Items 🚀

The following items are important for the long-term success and robustness of ProjectFlo but are deferred to later phases to allow for a quicker rollout of core functionality.

### 5.1 Database Seeding & Full API Testing

- **Database Seeding for Staging/Production:** Implement a robust strategy for seeding the Render PostgreSQL database for testing and initial production data. (Currently, manual seeding via local Prisma client is the workaround).
- **Comprehensive API Testing:** Conduct thorough end-to-end testing of all API endpoints once the frontend is integrated and initial data is in place.

### 5.2 Frontend-Backend Integration & Configuration

- **Frontend API Integration:** Fully connect the Vercel-deployed frontend to the live Render backend API (`https://projectflo.onrender.com`).
  - Configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=${env.PROJECTFLO_BACKEND_URL}` (or similar) in Vercel project settings.
  - Ensure all frontend features that consume backend services are functional.

### 5.3 Advanced DevOps & Monitoring

- **Advanced Error Monitoring:** Fully integrate Sentry (or similar) for both frontend (Vercel) and backend (Render) error tracking as outlined in the DevOps guide.
- **Logging Enhancements:** Implement more detailed structured logging (e.g., Pino) and explore centralized logging solutions if needed.
- **Automated E2E Tests:** Integrate automated End-to-End tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Advanced Health Checks:** Develop more comprehensive health check endpoints for the backend.
- **Automated Database Migrations for Staging/Preview:** Explore Render's Blueprint Previews or similar for managing database schema changes in pre-production environments.

### 5.4 Domain & Branding

- **Custom Domains:** Configure custom domains for frontend (e.g., `www.projectflo.com`) and backend (e.g., `api.projectflo.com`).

### 5.5 Feature Enhancements (Examples)

- **Redis Integration:** Fully leverage Redis for caching, session management, or queueing as outlined in the system architecture.
- **Terraform for IaC:** Implement Infrastructure as Code using Terraform for managing Render and other cloud resources, as initially planned.
