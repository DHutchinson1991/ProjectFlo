## Overview
Components are the building blocks of wedding videography deliverables. They represent individual video segments that can be combined to create final deliverables like highlight reels, ceremony films, and full documentaries.

## Core Concepts

### Component Types

#### Primary Component Types
- **Coverage-Based Components**: Require specific coverage to be filmed
  - Ceremony highlights, reception moments, speeches, dancing
- **Production Components**: Created entirely in post-production
  - Titles, transitions, credit sequences, motion graphics
- **Music Components**: Audio-driven segments with synchronized visuals
  - Music montages, dance sequences, emotional moments
- **Dialogue Components**: Speech-focused segments with clear audio
  - Vows, speeches, interviews, personal messages

#### Component Categories by Function
- **Narrative Components**: Tell the story (vows, speeches, reactions)
- **Contextual Components**: Provide setting (venue, details, atmosphere)
- **Transitional Components**: Connect segments (titles, fades, music breaks)
- **Supplemental Components**: Enhance experience (B-roll, montages)
- **Audio-Driven Components**: Music and dialogue-focused segments
- **Timeline Components**: Chronological event documentation

## Component Lifecycle

### Component States
```
PLANNED → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW → APPROVED → DELIVERED
         ↓
    REVISION_REQUIRED ← FEEDBACK_RECEIVED
```

### Component Configuration
Each component can be configured with:
- **Duration**: Target length for the component
- **Style**: Editing approach (cinematic, documentary, artistic)
- **Music**: Audio track selection and integration
- **Dialogue**: Speech content and audio treatment
- **Color Grading**: Visual tone and mood
- **Transitions**: How component connects to others
- **Timeline Position**: Where component fits in deliverable sequence
- **Sync Requirements**: Audio-visual synchronization needs

# Timeline Integration

## Component Timeline Placement
Components are designed to work seamlessly with the Visual Timeline Builder, where precise timing replaces traditional ordering systems.

#### Timeline-Aware Component Properties
Components provide essential data for timeline placement:
- **Estimated Duration**: Expected component length for timeline planning (e.g., 90 seconds)
- **Minimum Duration**: Shortest acceptable length for timeline constraints (e.g., 30 seconds)
- **Maximum Duration**: Longest acceptable length without affecting quality (e.g., 180 seconds)
- **Flexibility Rating**: How easily component can be time-adjusted (1-10 scale)
- **Snap Preference**: Optimal 5-second snap positions on timeline
- **Track Compatibility**: Which timeline tracks component works best on (Video/Audio/Graphics)

#### Component-Timeline Data Flow
```typescript
interface TimelineComponent {
  componentId: string;
  startTime: number;        // Seconds from timeline start (e.g., 210 for 00:03:30)
  endTime: number;          // Seconds from timeline start (e.g., 270 for 00:04:30)
  duration: number;         // Auto-calculated: endTime - startTime
  trackId: string;          // 'video' | 'audio' | 'graphics'
  snapPosition: number;     // Snapped to 5-second intervals
  estimatedHours: number;   // Task hours for this timeline placement
}
```

#### Timeline-Based Template Creation
1. **Component Selection**: Choose components from library based on coverage requirements
2. **Timeline Placement**: Drag components onto visual timeline with 5-second snap precision
3. **Duration Validation**: System validates component fits within acceptable duration ranges
4. **Pricing Integration**: Timeline placement automatically calculates task hours and pricing
5. **Template Persistence**: Complete timeline saved as deliverable template with exact timing

## Integration with Pricing Engine

#### Timeline-Based Hour Calculation
The timeline system directly feeds into pricing calculations:
- **Base Task Hours**: Each component has base editing hours (from `component_task_recipes`)
- **Duration Multiplier**: Timeline duration affects final task hours
- **Complexity Factors**: Component placement density and transitions affect pricing
- **Real-Time Updates**: Timeline changes immediately update quote pricing

#### Timeline Template Pricing Flow
```
Component Selection → Timeline Placement → Duration Calculation → 
Task Hour Generation → Pricing Multipliers → Final Quote Price
```
