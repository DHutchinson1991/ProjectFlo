## Overview

Tasks represent the actionable work items that need to be completed to deliver a wedding videography project. The task system orchestrates all work from pre-production planning through final delivery.

## Core Concepts

### Task Categories

- **Pre-Production Tasks**: Planning, scheduling, client consultation
- **Production Tasks**: Filming, coverage capture, equipment management
- **Post-Production Tasks**: Editing, review, revision, delivery
- **Administrative Tasks**: Communication, scheduling, billing

### Task Types

- **Coverage Tasks**: Capture specific coverage scenes
- **Component Tasks**: Create deliverable components
- **Review Tasks**: Client and internal quality reviews
- **Delivery Tasks**: Final deliverable preparation and delivery

## Task Lifecycle

### Task States

```
PENDING → ASSIGNED → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW → COMPLETED
         ↓
    BLOCKED ← REVISION_REQUIRED
```

### Task Dependencies

- **Sequential Dependencies**: Tasks that must complete before others start
- **Resource Dependencies**: Tasks requiring specific people or equipment
- **Content Dependencies**: Tasks needing specific coverage or components
- **Client Dependencies**: Tasks requiring client input or approval

## Data Model

### Task Schema

```

└── dependencyType: BLOCKS | REQUIRES_OUTPUT | SEQUENCE
```

## Task Generation

### Entity Default Task System (NEW)

Each entity type (Components, Deliverables, Coverage Scenes) maintains its own default task list:

- **Default Tasks**: Pre-defined task list with names, hours, and order for each entity
- **Task Templates**: Library of reusable task definitions that can be dragged into default tasks
- **Manual Tasks**: Custom tasks created specifically for an entity
- **Project Integration**: When entity is used in a project, default tasks are copied as actual project tasks

### Default Task Management

- **Components**: Each component has a default workflow of tasks needed to create it
- **Deliverables**: Each deliverable has default tasks for assembly, review, and delivery
- **Coverage Scenes**: Each coverage scene has default tasks for filming, processing, and review
- **Reusable Interface**: Single `DefaultTaskManager` component handles all entity types

### Automated Task Creation

The system automatically generates project tasks based on:

- **Entity Default Tasks**: Copies default tasks from components, deliverables, and coverage scenes when added to project
- **Project Timeline**: Schedules tasks based on event date and dependencies
- **Resource Availability**: Assigns tasks to available contributors
- **Template Integration**: Allows dragging task templates into default task lists

### Task Template System

Pre-defined task templates organized by category:

- **Production Templates**: Pre-production, filming, equipment tasks
- **Post-Production Templates**: Editing, review, export tasks
- **Coverage Templates**: Scene-specific filming and processing tasks
- **Delivery Templates**: Final delivery and client handoff tasks

## Resource Management

### Task Assignment

- **Skill Matching**: Assign tasks based on contributor expertise
- **Workload Balancing**: Distribute tasks across team members
- **Timeline Optimization**: Schedule tasks for efficient workflow
- **Equipment Allocation**: Reserve equipment for specific tasks

### Capacity Planning

- **Hour Estimation**: Predict task duration based on complexity
- **Resource Conflicts**: Identify scheduling conflicts
- **Deadline Management**: Ensure tasks complete before project deadline
- **Overtime Tracking**: Monitor team capacity and workload

## Integration Points

### With Coverage

- **Coverage Tasks**: Generate filming tasks for required coverage
- **Scene Completion**: Track coverage capture progress
- **Quality Gates**: Ensure coverage meets requirements before proceeding

### With Components

- **Component Tasks**: Create editing tasks for each component
- **Asset Dependencies**: Link tasks to required coverage and assets
- **Review Cycles**: Generate review tasks for component approval

### With Deliverables

- **Deliverable Assembly**: Tasks for combining components into final deliverables
- **Quality Control**: Review tasks for deliverable validation
- **Client Delivery**: Tasks for final delivery and client handoff

### With Pricing

- **Time Tracking**: Actual hours vs. estimated for pricing accuracy
- **Resource Costs**: Track contributor time for cost analysis
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Measure task performance for future estimates

## Workflow Orchestration

### Task Scheduling

1. **Dependency Resolution**: Order tasks based on dependencies
2. **Resource Allocation**: Assign tasks to available contributors
3. **Timeline Creation**: Schedule tasks within project timeline
4. **Buffer Management**: Add time buffers for risk mitigation

### Progress Tracking

1. **Status Updates**: Real-time task status monitoring
2. **Milestone Tracking**: Key project checkpoint completion
3. **Bottleneck Identification**: Detect and resolve workflow blocks
4. **Performance Analytics**: Measure task completion efficiency

### Exception Handling

1. **Blocked Task Resolution**: Identify and resolve dependencies
2. **Resource Reallocation**: Reassign tasks when contributors unavailable
3. **Timeline Adjustment**: Modify schedules when delays occur
4. **Escalation Procedures**: Alert management to critical issues

## Task Complexity System

Tasks include complexity ratings (1-10 scale) to help with workload planning and contributor assignment:

- **Complexity Assignment**: Admins assign complexity ratings during task template creation
- **Usage**: Helps match contributor skill levels to appropriate task difficulty
- **Aggregation**: Task complexity rolls up to component and deliverable complexity ratings

_For detailed complexity calculation and usage, see [Complexity Guide](Complexity Guide.md)_
