# User Interface Architecture

## Overview
The ProjectFlo user interface implements a role-based, responsive design system that provides intuitive access to the complex video production workflow management capabilities.

## UI Architecture Principles

### Design System Foundation
- **Consistent Component Library**: Reusable UI components across all interfaces
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop optimization
- **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout
- **Role-Based Interfaces**: Tailored experiences for Admin, Contributor, and Client roles

### Template System
- **Template A - Dashboard Layout**: Internal application with sidebar navigation
- **Template B - Centered Content**: Public-facing pages and focused workflows
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular UI components for maintainability

## Core Interface Components

### Admin Command Center
The primary interface for business management and project oversight.

#### Dashboard Interface
- **Activity Feed**: Real-time notifications and team activity stream
- **Performance Metrics**: Revenue tracking, project health, productivity stats
- **Quick Actions**: Rapid access to common tasks (new quote, project, client)
- **Business Intelligence**: Profitability analysis and trend visualization

#### Project Management Interface
- **Project Overview**: High-level project summary with key metrics
- **Task Management**: Comprehensive task assignment and progress tracking
- **Financial Dashboard**: Revenue vs cost analysis, invoice management
- **File Management**: Integration with Frame.io for asset organization

### Template Management Interface
Advanced interface for deliverable and component configuration.

#### Component Builder
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Visual component selection and arrangement
- **Live Preview**: Real-time complexity calculation and pricing updates
- **Component Library**: Global pool of reusable video components
- **Compatibility Validation**: Automatic detection of component conflicts

#### Music Configuration Interface
- **Multi-Level Music Selection**: Deliverable and component-level music options  
- **Music Type Filtering**: Genre-based filtering (orchestral, modern, vintage)
- **Preview Integration**: Audio preview functionality for music selection
- **Style Integration**: Music preferences tied to editing styles

### Real-Time Collaboration Features
- **Live Updates**: WebSocket-powered real-time data synchronization
- **Notification System**: In-app notifications for critical events
- **Activity Streams**: Team activity tracking and communication
- **Collaborative Editing**: Multi-user template and project editing

## Responsive Design Strategy

### Breakpoint System
- **Mobile**: 320px - 767px (Touch-optimized navigation)
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1023px (Hybrid touch/mouse interface)
- **Desktop**: 1024px+ (Full-featured interface)

### Adaptive Interface Features
- **Collapsible Navigation**: Sidebar collapses on smaller screens
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features revealed as screen size increases
- **Touch-Friendly Controls**: Larger tap targets on mobile devices
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility on desktop

## Data Visualization Components

### Business Analytics Interface
- **Revenue Dashboard**: Financial performance tracking and forecasting
- **Project Timeline Visualization**: Gantt-style project scheduling
- **Resource Utilization Charts**: Team capacity and workload analysis
- **Client Satisfaction Metrics**: Feedback and rating visualization

### Interactive Data Components
- **Filterable Tables**: Advanced filtering and sorting for large datasets
- **Interactive Charts**: Drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis
- **Real-Time Metrics**: Live updating performance indicators
- **Export Functionality**: Data export in multiple formats

## Accessibility Architecture

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality without mouse
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Color Contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order

### Assistive Technology Support
- **Screen Reader Optimization**: Structured content hierarchy
- **Voice Control**: Voice navigation support for hands-free operation
- **High Contrast Mode**: Alternative color schemes for visual impairments
- **Text Scaling**: Support for 200% text zoom without loss of functionality

## Performance Optimization

### Loading Strategy
- **Progressive Loading**: Critical content loads first, secondary content follows
- **Image Optimization**: Responsive images with appropriate compression
- **Code Splitting**: JavaScript bundles split by route and feature
- **Caching Strategy**: Aggressive caching for static assets, smart caching for dynamic content

### User Experience Optimization
- **Optimistic UI Updates**: Immediate feedback for user actions
- **Loading States**: Clear indication of system processing
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling with recovery options
- **Offline Capability**: Basic functionality available without internet connection

## Integration Points

### With Backend Systems
- **API Integration**: RESTful API communication with proper error handling
- **WebSocket Connections**: Real-time data updates and notifications
- **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop file upload with progress indication
- **Authentication Flow**: Seamless login/logout with session management

### With External Services
- **Frame.io Integration**: Embedded video review and collaboration tools
- **Payment Processing**: Secure payment interface integration
- **Communication Tools**: Email and SMS automation triggers
- **Analytics Integration**: User behavior tracking and conversion measurement
