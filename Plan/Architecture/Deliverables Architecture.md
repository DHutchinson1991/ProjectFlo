## Overview
Deliverables are the final products delivered to clients - complete videos assembled from individual components. They represent the culmination of all project work and are what clients ultimately receive and experience.

## Core Concepts

### Deliverable Types
- **Highlight Reel**: 3-5 minute wedding day summary with key moments
- **Ceremony Film**: Complete ceremony coverage with full vows and rituals
- **Reception Film**: Full reception coverage including speeches and activities
- **Full Documentary**: Comprehensive wedding day documentation (2-4 hours)
- **Social Media Clips**: Short-form content optimized for social platforms
- **Raw Footage**: Unedited coverage files for client archival

### Deliverable Categories
- **Primary Deliverables**: Main client-facing videos (highlight reel, ceremony film)
- **Secondary Deliverables**: Additional content (reception film, social clips)
- **Archive Deliverables**: Complete coverage for client records
- **Derivative Deliverables**: Versions optimized for specific platforms or uses

## Deliverable Composition

### Component Assembly
Deliverables are assembled from multiple components in a specific order:
- **Opening Sequence**: Title card, couple introduction
- **Ceremony Highlights**: Key ceremony moments in narrative order
- **Portrait Montage**: Couple and family portraits with music
- **Reception Highlights**: Speeches, dances, celebration moments
- **Closing Sequence**: Final moments, credits, contact information

### Assembly Rules
- **Narrative Flow**: Components arranged to tell coherent story
- **Pacing Management**: Balance energy levels throughout deliverable
- **Transition Consistency**: Smooth connections between components
- **Audio Continuity**: Seamless audio flow across component boundaries

## Visual Timeline Builder (Primary Template System)

### Timeline-Based Template Builder
The Visual Timeline Builder replaces traditional component ordering with precise visual timeline placement, becoming the primary method for creating deliverable templates.

#### Timeline Template Interface
```typescript
interface TimelineTemplate {
  deliverableId: string;
  totalDuration: number;        // Total timeline length in seconds
  snapInterval: number;         // 5-second snap precision
  tracks: TimelineTrack[];      // Video, Audio, Graphics layers
  components: PlacedComponent[]; // Components with exact timing
  markers: TimelineMarker[];    // Important timing notes
}

interface PlacedComponent {
  componentId: string;
  componentName: string;
  startTime: number;            // Seconds from start (e.g., 210 for 00:03:30)
  endTime: number;              // Seconds from start (e.g., 270 for 00:04:30)
  duration: number;             // Auto-calculated duration
  trackId: string;              // Which track/layer
  snapPosition: number;         // Snapped to 5-second intervals
  color: string;                // Visual identification
  type: ComponentType;          // Component category
}
```

#### Timeline Display Features
- **5-Second Snap Grid**: All components automatically align to 5-second intervals
- **Multi-Track Layout**: Separate tracks for Video, Audio, Graphics, and Notes
- **Precise Timecode**: Shows exact start/end times (00:03:30 - 00:04:30)
- **Visual Duration**: Component blocks sized proportional to actual duration
- **Real-Time Calculation**: Total deliverable duration updates as components are placed
- **Drag-and-Drop Placement**: Intuitive component positioning with snap assistance

#### Template Building Workflow
1. **Component Selection**: Choose components from library palette
2. **Timeline Placement**: Drag components onto timeline tracks at desired positions  
3. **Automatic Snapping**: Components snap to 5-second grid for clean positioning
4. **Duration Validation**: Visual feedback for timeline length and gaps
5. **Template Persistence**: Save complete timeline as deliverable template
6. **Client Presentation**: Export timeline visualization for client approval

### Template Data Persistence

#### Database Storage
Timeline templates store complete timing specifications rather than simple component ordering:

**Traditional Approach:**
```sql
-- Simple component ordering
deliverable_components: [
  { order: 1, component_id: 'ceremony_vows' },
  { order: 2, component_id: 'first_dance' },
  { order: 3, component_id: 'reception_fun' }
]
```

**Timeline Template Approach:**
```sql
-- Precise timing specifications
timeline_components: [
  { 
    component_id: 'ceremony_vows',
    start_time: 0,      -- 00:00:00
    end_time: 120,      -- 00:02:00
    track_id: 'video',
    snap_position: 0
  },
  {
    component_id: 'first_dance', 
    start_time: 120,    -- 00:02:00
    end_time: 240,      -- 00:04:00
    track_id: 'video',
    snap_position: 120
  },
  {
    component_id: 'reception_fun',
    start_time: 240,    -- 00:04:00  
    end_time: 360,      -- 00:06:00
    track_id: 'video',
    snap_position: 240
  }
]
```

#### Template Benefits

- **Visual Planning**: See deliverable structure before production begins
- **Client Communication**: Clear timeline presentation for client approval
- **Editor Guidance**: Provide specific timing requirements to video editors
- **Flexible Adjustments**: Easy repositioning without losing precise timing data

## Timeline-Based Planning and Presentation

### Timeline Template Library
Pre-built timeline templates with optimal component placement and timing:

#### Standard Timeline Templates
- **Highlight Reel Template**: 3-5 minute structure with ceremony, portraits, and reception segments
- **Ceremony Film Template**: 8-12 minute structure focused on complete ceremony coverage
- **Reception Film Template**: 6-10 minute structure featuring speeches, dances, and celebration
- **Social Media Template**: 15-60 second clips optimized for social platform requirements

#### Template Timing Guidelines
Each template provides default component placement on 5-second snap intervals:
- **Opening Sequence**: 00:00:00 - 00:00:30 (30 seconds)
- **Main Content Blocks**: Placed at optimal 5-second intervals throughout timeline
- **Transition Spacing**: 5-second buffers between major content sections
- **Closing Sequence**: Final 15-30 seconds for credits and contact information

### Client Timeline Presentation

#### Visual Timeline Exports
- **Timeline Overview**: Complete timeline visualization showing all components and timing
- **Segment Breakdown**: Detailed view of each timeline section with component specifications
- **Duration Summary**: Total deliverable length with breakdown by content type
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators showing completion status of each timeline component

#### Client Approval Workflow
1. **Timeline Presentation**: Share visual timeline for client review and approval
2. **Timing Adjustments**: Client can request component timing modifications
3. **Content Approval**: Client approves specific component placement and duration
4. **Final Timeline Lock**: Approved timeline becomes production specification
5. **Progress Updates**: Client can track production progress against approved timeline
