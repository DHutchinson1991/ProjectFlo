## Overview
Coverage represents the foundational filming requirements for wedding videography. It defines what needs to be captured during the wedding event to fulfill client deliverables.

## Core Concepts

### Coverage Types
- **Ceremony Coverage**: Processional, vows, rings, kiss, recessional
- **Reception Coverage**: Introductions, speeches, first dance, cake cutting
- **Portrait Coverage**: Couple portraits, family photos, bridal party
- **Detail Coverage**: Rings, dress, flowers, venue details
- **Candid Coverage**: Guest interactions, emotional moments

### Coverage Scenes
Each coverage type breaks down into specific scenes that must be captured:
- **Scene Requirements**: Specific shots needed (wide, medium, close-up)
- **Duration**: Minimum capture time for each scene
- **Priority**: Critical vs. optional scenes
- **Dependencies**: Scenes that must be captured together

## Data Model

### Coverage Schema
```
Coverage
├── id: Unique identifier
├── name: Coverage type name
├── description: What this coverage entails
├── isRequired: Whether this coverage is mandatory
├── estimatedDuration: Expected filming time
└── scenes: Related CoverageScene records

## Integration Points

### With Components
- **Coverage-Based Components**: Require specific coverage to be filmed
- **Scene Mapping**: Components specify which coverage scenes they need
- **Quality Requirements**: Components define coverage quality standards

### With Tasks
- **Filming Tasks**: Generated from coverage requirements
- **Scheduling**: Coverage drives filming timeline
- **Resource Allocation**: Coverage determines crew and equipment needs

### With Deliverables
- **Content Source**: Coverage provides raw material for deliverables
- **Quality Validation**: Ensures coverage meets deliverable standards
- **Completeness Check**: Verifies all required coverage is captured

### With Pricing
- **Coverage Pricing**: Time-based pricing for each coverage type
- **Complexity Multipliers**: Difficult coverage affects pricing
- **Resource Costs**: Coverage determines crew and equipment costs

## Workflow Integration

### Pre-Production
1. **Coverage Planning**: Define required coverage based on deliverables
2. **Scene Breakdown**: Detail specific scenes for each coverage type
3. **Timeline Creation**: Schedule coverage throughout event
4. **Resource Planning**: Allocate crew and equipment per coverage

### Production
1. **Coverage Tracking**: Monitor completion of required coverage
2. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure coverage meets standards
3. **Backup Planning**: Alternative coverage if primary fails
4. **Real-time Adjustment**: Adapt coverage based on event flow

### Post-Production
1. **Coverage Review**: Assess captured coverage quality
2. **Gap Identification**: Identify missing or inadequate coverage
3. **Deliverable Validation**: Confirm coverage supports deliverables
4. **Archive Organization**: Structure coverage for future access
