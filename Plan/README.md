## 📝 Maintenance Guidelines

### When to Update
- **Code Changes:** Update relevant Architecture and Data documents
- **Requirement Changes:** Update Product Requirements, cascade to other docs
- **Design Changes:** Update Design docs, reference in Architecture
- **Implementation Progress:** Update Implementation status in all relevant docs

### Version Control
- All documents version controlled with codebase
- Implementation status updated during development sprints
- Cross-references maintained during document updates
- New features require documentation before code completion
