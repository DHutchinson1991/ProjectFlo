<!-- ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ INTRODUCTION ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ -->

## 1. Purpose 🎯

This document defines the foundational layout system, grid structure, and spacing principles for the ProjectFlo platform.

> **Key Principle:**  
> Consistent spatial design creates a professional, cohesive user experience.

<!-- ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ DESIGN PHILOSOPHY ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ -->

## 2. Design Philosophy 💡

Our layout will be **clean, responsive, and content-first**. The structure should feel intuitive and never distract the user from their task. We will prioritize clarity and consistency over complex or novel layouts.

### 2.1 Content-First Approach

> **Core Principle:** Our design choices are driven by the need to present information clearly and logically. The layout will serve the content, not the other way around.

**Key Elements:**

1. Strong visual hierarchy
2. Progressive disclosure
3. Clear information architecture
4. Consistent spacing patterns

## 3. Responsive Grid System 🌐

All page layouts will be built on a **12-column responsive grid**. This provides maximum flexibility for arranging content while maintaining a consistent structure.

### 3.1 Base Grid Properties

| Property | Value | Notes                              |
| :------- | :---- | :--------------------------------- |
| Columns  | 12    | Standard responsive grid           |
| Gutter   | 24px  | Consistent spacing between columns |
| Margin   | 32px  | Breathing room on viewport edges   |

### 3.2 Breakpoints

| Size | Width  | Use Case          |
| :--- | :----- | :---------------- |
| SM   | 640px  | Mobile devices    |
| MD   | 768px  | Tablets portrait  |
| LG   | 1024px | Tablets landscape |
| XL   | 1280px | Desktop displays  |

### 3.3 Vertical Rhythm

**Base Unit:** 8px

#### Typography Spacing

- Body (16px): 24px line height (1.5)
- Headings: Multiples of base unit
- Margins: Aligned to 8px grid

**Benefits:**

- Consistent vertical alignment
- Harmonious text spacing
- Predictable component spacing

## 4. Spacing System 📐

### 4.1 Spatial Units

| Unit       | Size | Usage                       |
| :--------- | :--- | :-------------------------- |
| Base Unit  | 8px  | Standard spacing unit       |
| Small Unit | 4px  | For subtle adjustments      |
| Large Unit | 16px | For larger gaps and margins |

### 4.2 Application

- **Padding and Margins:** Use multiples of the base unit for all padding and margins.
- **Grid Gutters:** Set at 24px to maintain consistency with the column grid.
- **Section Spacing:** Vertical spacing between sections should be at least 32px.

**Note:** Always opt for even-numbered multiples of the base unit to maintain alignment in the 8px grid.

## 5. Responsive Breakpoints 📱

To ensure a seamless experience across devices, the following breakpoints will be used:

| Breakpoint | Width          | Description                    |
| :--------- | :------------- | :----------------------------- |
| Mobile     | < 640px        | For small screens              |
| Tablet     | 641px - 1024px | For tablets and small laptops  |
| Desktop    | > 1024px       | For large screens and desktops |

**Implementation:**

- Use CSS media queries to apply styles at each breakpoint.
- Test layouts at each breakpoint to ensure proper alignment and spacing.
