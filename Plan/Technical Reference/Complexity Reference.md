## Overview
The complexity system provides admins and contributors with workload difficulty indicators. Complexity ratings help with workload planning, contributor assignment, and project difficulty assessment.

## Complexity Scale
All complexity ratings use a **1-10 scale**:
- **1-3**: Simple/Basic - Straightforward tasks requiring minimal experience
- **4-6**: Moderate - Standard tasks requiring some skill and attention
- **7-8**: Complex - Challenging tasks requiring significant experience
- **9-10**: Expert - Highly complex tasks requiring specialized skills

## Task Complexity Assignment

### Admin Assignment Process
- **Who Assigns**: Admins assign complexity ratings during task template creation
- **When Assigned**: During initial task template setup and periodic reviews
- **Factors Considered**:
  - Technical skill requirements
  - Time pressure and deadline sensitivity
  - Creative decision-making complexity
  - Coordination with other team members
  - Client interaction requirements

### Task Complexity Examples
```
Task Examples by Complexity Level:

1-3 (Simple):
- Basic file organization
- Simple audio level adjustments
- Standard color correction application

4-6 (Moderate):
- Multi-camera sync and editing
- Music selection and timing
- Client revision implementation

7-8 (Complex):
- Advanced color grading workflows
- Complex audio mixing and mastering
- Creative problem-solving for difficult footage

9-10 (Expert):
- Emergency timeline recovery
- High-stakes client presentation edits
- Technical innovation for unique requirements
```

## Component Complexity Calculation

### Weighted Average Formula
Component complexity is calculated as a **duration-weighted average** of all component tasks:

```
Component Complexity = Œ£(Task Complexity √ó Task Duration Hours) / Œ£(Task Duration Hours)
```

### Calculation Example
```
Component: "Ceremony Highlights"
Tasks:
- Raw footage review (Complexity: 3, Duration: 2 hours) = 6 points
- Multi-camera editing (Complexity: 6, Duration: 4 hours) = 24 points  
- Color grading (Complexity: 7, Duration: 1 hour) = 7 points
- Audio mixing (Complexity: 5, Duration: 1 hour) = 5 points

Total: 42 complexity points / 8 total hours = 5.25 complexity rating
```

### Component Complexity Display
- **Admin Interface**: Shows calculated complexity rating with breakdown
- **Task Assignment**: Helps match contributor skill level to component difficulty
- **Workload Planning**: Identifies which components require more experienced team members

## Deliverable Complexity Calculation

### Simple Average Formula
Deliverable complexity is calculated as a **simple average** of all component complexities in the timeline:

```
Deliverable Complexity = Œ£(Component Complexity) / Number of Components
```

### Calculation Example
```
Deliverable: "Wedding Highlight Reel"
Timeline Components:
- Opening Sequence (Complexity: 4.2)
- Ceremony Highlights (Complexity: 5.25)
- Portrait Montage (Complexity: 3.8)
- Reception Highlights (Complexity: 6.1)
- Closing Credits (Complexity: 2.5)

Total: 21.85 / 5 components = 4.37 complexity rating
```

### Deliverable Complexity Applications
- **Project Planning**: Assess overall project difficulty before assignment
- **Resource Allocation**: Allocate more experienced team members to complex deliverables
- **Timeline Estimation**: Higher complexity may require additional buffer time
- **Quality Assurance**: Complex deliverables may need additional review cycles

## Display and Usage

### Admin Dashboard
- **Project Overview**: Show deliverable complexity ratings for quick assessment
- **Team Assignment**: Display complexity alongside contributor skill levels
- **Workload Balance**: Monitor complexity distribution across team members

### Contributor Interface
- **Task Lists**: Show individual task complexity ratings
- **Skill Development**: Track progression on increasingly complex tasks
- **Workload Awareness**: Understand difficulty of assigned work

### Planning Applications
- **Capacity Planning**: Balance high/low complexity work across team
- **Training Programs**: Identify skill gaps based on complexity requirements
- **Client Communication**: Set appropriate expectations for complex projects

## Integration Points

### With Task System
- **Task Templates**: Store complexity ratings in task template definitions
- **Task Assignment**: Consider complexity when assigning tasks to contributors
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor completion rates by complexity level

### With Component System
- **Component Library**: Display calculated complexity ratings for each component type
- **Timeline Planning**: Use complexity to estimate total project difficulty
- **Quality Standards**: Higher complexity components may require additional review

### With Team Management
- **Contributor Profiles**: Track individual skill levels and preferred complexity ranges
- **Assignment Logic**: Match contributor capabilities to task/component complexity
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor success rates across different complexity levels
