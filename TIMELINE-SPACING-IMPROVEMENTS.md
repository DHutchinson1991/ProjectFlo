# Timeline Builder UI Improvements - Vertical Spacing & Track Layout

## Changes Made ✅

### 1. **Removed Track Types Tooltip**

- Completely removed the track legend/tooltip that was appearing on top-right
- Eliminated potential overlay issues
- Cleaner, more focused interface

### 2. **Increased Vertical Spacing**

- **Track Heights Increased**:

  - Graphics: 70px → 80px (+10px)
  - Video: 90px → 100px (+10px)
  - Audio: 60px → 70px (+10px)
  - Music: 50px → 60px (+10px)

- **Track Spacing Increased**:
  - Between tracks: 10px → 20px (doubled spacing)
  - Total track area calculation: `tracks.length * 110 + 50` (was `90 + 50`)

### 3. **Enhanced Track Layout**

- **Container Height**: 400px → 500px (+100px)
- **Better Visual Separation**: 20px gaps between tracks for cleaner appearance
- **Proportional Component Heights**: Components scale with track heights

### 4. **Updated Positioning Logic**

- **Track Headers**: Use new spacing calculation `30 + index * (height + 20)`
- **Timeline Grid**: Matching spacing for perfect alignment
- **Component Positioning**: Updated to match track positions
- **Drag Detection**: Mouse-over detection uses new spacing for accurate track targeting

## Visual Results

### Before:

- Cramped tracks with 10px spacing
- Smaller track heights
- Track tooltip overlay
- 400px container height

### After:

- Spacious tracks with 20px spacing
- Larger track heights for better visibility
- Clean interface without tooltip
- 500px container height
- Better component visibility and interaction

## Track Layout Summary

```
Ruler Area:           30px
Graphics Track:       80px height
Spacing:              20px
Video Track:          100px height
Spacing:              20px
Audio Track:          70px height
Spacing:              20px
Music Track:          60px height
Total Height:         ~390px (within 500px container)
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Clear separation between track types
2. **Improved Usability**: Easier to target tracks during drag operations
3. **Professional Appearance**: More spacious, less cluttered interface
4. **Enhanced Readability**: Track content more visible with increased heights
5. **Better Component Interaction**: Larger hit targets for components

The timeline now provides a much more comfortable and professional editing experience with proper vertical spacing that allows Graphics, Video, Audio, and Music tracks to sit nicely on top of each other without feeling cramped.
